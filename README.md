# myconfigs
This repo contains some of my current Linux configs - I am using Arch on my Mini PC (GMKTec - running as a K3S control-plane node) and on my Laptop (Dell - running as a k3s agent).
Besides Linux configs, this repo also contains some of the scripts that I wrote to play with processes, threads using Python, Bash script and automatically do things like systemd unit files

## Purpose
This repo is a playground for me to practice/learn/play with Linux/OS internals.
