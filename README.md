# myconfigs

This repo contains some of my current Linux configurations.  

I’m running:
- **Arch Linux** on my Mini PC (GMKTec — acting as a k3s control-plane node)  
- **Arch Linux** on my Laptop (Dell — running as a k3s agent)  

Besides configs, this repo also includes scripts I wrote to:
- Experiment with processes and threads (Python, Bash)  
- Automate tasks (e.g., systemd unit files)  

## Purpose

A playground for me to practice, learn, and experiment with Linux/OS internals.
